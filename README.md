# University Project for the Recommender Systems elective course in FMI (Sofia University), 2nd Semester 2021/2022

Experiments based on the RecSys 2021 article, *"Analyzing Item Popularity Bias of Music Recommender Systems: Are Different Genders Equally Affected?"*.

Using the LFM-2b dataset (consisting of over 2 billion interactions from the online music platform Last.fm), a small subset is sampled and has several recommender system algorithms applied to it via the *Surprise* Python library.
The results are then evaluated with various metrics.
